// A block can return an expression.
print({
    "Hello World !"
}); // Expected output: "Hello World !".

// An if is an expression.
print(if 1 < 2 {
    0
} else {
    1
}); // Expected output: "0".

// A loop is also an expression and can be used an array.
let doubles = for number in [0, 1, 2] {
    number * 2
};

// Potential issues:
// Maybe creating arrays in loops is excessive.

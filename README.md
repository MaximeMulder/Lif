# Lif

## License

This project was written by Maxime Mulder and is distributed under the MIT license.

## Introduction

This repository contains the source code of an interpreter for the Lif programming language, an original programming language and a personnal project.

## How to build

This program is written in Rust, you can download the compiler and tools for the language [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
Once installed, you need to switch to Rust nightly using the command `rustup default nightly`.
Finally, you can use the command `cargo build` in the project root directory to build the program.

## How to run

In order to run Lif code, you must first write it in a text file.
Then, you can use this interpreter by providing it the file path as a command line argument.

## Language

You can check the "src/tests/" directory to see examples of working Lif code. There is currently no better documentation because I like to experiment freely with the language.

## Maintainance

This project will probably receive updates when I feel like working on it, which may be a little random.
